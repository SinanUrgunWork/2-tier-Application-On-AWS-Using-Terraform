I deployed a robust 2-tier application on AWS, leveraging Terraform for efficient infrastructure management. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the services and architecture:

Amazon EC2: Handles compute with auto-scaling to adjust resources based on demand.
Amazon RDS & DynamoDB: Provide a relational and NoSQL database backbone, ensuring high availability and performance.
Amazon VPC: Creates a secure and isolated network for the application.
Amazon S3: Used for storing backend configurations with enhanced version control.
Amazon CloudFront: Distributes content globally to improve application delivery speed.
Amazon Route 53: Manages DNS for reliable user requests routing.
Amazon Certificate Manager: Secures connections with SSL/TLS certificates.
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors and alerts on application and infrastructure health.
This project not only enhanced my expertise in AWS but also deepened my skills in using Terraform to automate and replicate environments with precision. The entire architecture is designed for scalability, security, and resilience, ensuring that the application can handle varied loads efficiently.
